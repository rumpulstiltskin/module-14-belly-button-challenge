## Overview of Project
Built an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity DataSet](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/).<br>
The dashboard is composed of three charts:<br>
1. A bar chart that displays the top 10 bacterial species in a volunteer's navel.<br>
2. A bubble chart that displays each bacterial species found in a volunteer's navel.<br>
3. A gauge chart that displays the weekly washing frequency of the volunteer.<br>
The dashboard also displays the volunteer's demographic information.<br>
